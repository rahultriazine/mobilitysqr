Sure, there are a few reasons why this might not happen – variable sensitivity to the</div><div>compound, interference from other medications. By and large, though, we tend to accept that</div><div>medicines work as intended. But there’s one complication that’s giving the medical industry fits: the</div><div>placebo effect. To wit, 11 percent of balding men given a sugar pill start to re-grow hair (versus 26</div><div>percent using Rogaine). 60 percent of patients suffering from chronic pain who are told they’re receiving</div><div>morphine but get saline instead experience complete relief.</div><div>Although the phenomenon has been recognized since the days of the ancient Greeks who named it, the</div><div>placebo effect remains little understood. In the past few years, research has established that it definitely</div><div>exists, and it’s neither bias (“all in your mind”) nor natural history (normal fluctuation of symptoms).</div><div>Placebos work through specific brain pathways and can have a profound impact on autonomic functions</div><div>like endocrine activity and the immune system as well as cognitive functions like mood and memory.</div><div>And the medical community is taking notice. The first over-the-counter placebo, Obecalp, for</div><div>nonspecific childhood ailments, went on sale this summer. The new consensus around the placebo</div><div>effect raises profound questions. If an inert substance like sugar or saline relieves pain in 20 percent of</div><div>people and an analgesic helps 21 percent of recipients suffering from the same illness, did the medicine</div><div>have much to do with it? Drug companies try to answer this question in two ways. First, they routinely</div><div>start their trials with a placebo-only study and throw out all the candidates who showed a strong</div><div>response, retaining the rest for testing. Second, they match their drug tests with control groups who</div><div>receive only placebo. To gain FDA approval, the drug must outperform the placebo, if only marginally.</div><div>There are problems with this system. For one, by rejecting people who respond to placebos, researchers</div><div>make the placebo look less effective than it really is, skewing their results in favor of their drug. It also</div><div>opens a loophole that pharma companies use to fudge results — say, by switching participants from the</div><div>drug group to the placebo group so lingering side effects can be attributed to the placebo. Moreover,</div><div>when a drug beats the placebo, it’s likely that some percentage of recipients improved due not to</div><div>the medication but to the placebo effect. Was it a small portion or the lion’s share? There's no way to</div><div>know. Sometimes the placebo outperforms the medicine it’s pitted against. Ted Kaptchuk at Harvard</div><div>found that placebo treatment tested better than any existing med in 270 patients with irritable bowel</div><div>syndrome. Most mysterious, beneficial placebo effects are often accompanied by a negative “nocebo”</div><div>effect that parallels harmful drug side effects.These issues have become the elephant in the clinic, especially when it comes to the efficacy of the class</div><div>of drugs known as SSRIs. Treatments like Prozac and Zoloft are the most frequently prescribed meds for</div><div>depression - and the most profitable class of drugs on the market, accounting for $10 billion annually in</div><div>profit. Doctors report that they have undeniable positive, even life-saving effects in some patients. Yet</div><div>in clinical trials, they rarely outperform placebos, and when they do, it’s only slightly. Drug companies</div><div>are desperate to demonstrate that SSRIs are effective. “The placebo effect is overwhelming the ability to</div><div>make a distinction between the pharmacology of a drug and an inert imitation,” Kaptchuk observes. All</div><div>of which makes it a top scientific priority to understand the placebo effect. The NIH made a special call</div><div>for proposals eight years ago, and research has exploded since then. Thanks to sophisticated brain</div><div>imaging techniques and cleverly designed studies, researchers are closing in on the mechanisms that</div><div>underlie the phenomenon and devising test procedures that can distinguish it from drug-induced</div><div>effects. Jon-Kar Zubieta at University of Michigan is studying whether responsiveness to placebos is</div><div>related to estrogen and testosterone levels. To minimize placebo effects in clinical trials, Fabrizio</div><div>Benedetti at the University of Turin suggest supplementing overt drug tests, which presumably activate</div><div>some degree of placebo effect, with a group of subjects on an IV drip so they can’t tell whether or when</div><div>they’re getting dosed. A comparison would reveal the drug’s own placebo nature.</div><div>We've made contact with a few pharma insiders about the havoc the placebo effect is bringing to their</div><div>industry, and with researchers about what it means and how we might cope. Medicine will be changed</div><div>by the current ferment. Let’s capture the transitional moment and offer a glimpse into the future.</div><div  id="footer_content"><div style="width: 100%;text-align: center;border-top: 1px solid;padding-top: 5px;">246, Phase IV, Udyog Vihar,Gurugram, Haryana-122016 (India)Tel: +91 97111 89970</div></div></body></html>
